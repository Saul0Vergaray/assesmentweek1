//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you.

const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added." 
const AnalysisofRequirements = "This is the second step, it is the process of defining user expectations for a new. software being built or modified"
const Design = "this is the third step, it is an important part in sldc, in the design phase, one or more designs are created to achieve the project result"
const implementation = "this is the fourth step, it is the time during which a project is being made, this time is also used to test, adjust and correct the project"
const testingandintegration = "This is the fifth step, in this step individual software modules are tested as a group"
const Maintain = " this is the last step, this happens after the project is fully operational, this incliudes uprgades and repair of software if it breaks"
